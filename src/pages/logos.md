## Variants

The logo has different variants for screen and print sizes. Use the largest variant that is suitable for each use case.

Use the single-color or inverted single-color variants where the use of color is not permitted. For the small logo, use the variant that maximizes contrast with the background.

## Clear Space

Maintain a margin of one “pupil to face edge“ around the logo.

If the selected logo variant features shadows, do not factor the shadows into the clear space
