# Engineering Interview Process

For engineering candidates, there are four stages to the interview process.

## Intro Call

This interview is a 30-minute video call for us to get to know each other.

## Coding Challenge

The coding challenge is "homework" that should not take longer than 4 hours.

You will be asked to submit a pull request on GitHub with your changes, so we can discuss them during a 20-minute follow-up call.

We want to see how you think and approach challenges.

## Technical Interview

The goal of this 1-hour video call is to test your technical knowledge and expertise.

Please be prepared to discuss technologies, architecture, and best practices.

## Team Interview

We collaborate in teams and strongly believe that it is essential to feel connected and engaged with your teammates.

This interview is a chance for you to get to know the team, and vice versa.
