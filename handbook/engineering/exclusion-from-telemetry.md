# Exclusion from Telemetry

As described in [Measuring Product Adoption](./measuring-product-adoption.md), we track product and website analytics.

Our work will often require using our product and viewing our websites. In order to keep our analytics data as representative of our user base as possible, we encourage employees to disable telemetry.

## Product Telemetry

Please refer to the [Resoto documentation](https://resoto.com/docs/reference/telemetry#disabling) for information on how to disable product telemetry.

## Website Telemtry

To toggle whether your visits are included in our company website analytics, visit [Website Analytics](/website-analytics) and click the button.

For exclusion from product website analytics, please click the same button on the [Resoto website](https://resoto.com/website-analytics).
