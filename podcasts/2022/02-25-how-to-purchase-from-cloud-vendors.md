# Episode 1: How to Purchase from Cloud Vendors

Companies build in the cloud for growth and speed. Engineering teams love building new things—so much that cloud spend at some point becomes a major part of a company's P&L. Cloud vendors have introduced pricing and discounting schemes to incentivize more consumption and lock-in long-term commitments from customers. That's when management gets involved, but they often lack the context and understanding of how cloud procurement works. Forecasting cloud spend and aligning growth with infrastructure efficiency become important capabilities when you are about to sign a multi-million three-year contract with a cloud vendor.

In this episode, Lars talks to Dieter Matzion, Senior Cloud Governance Engineer at Roku, Inc. and long-time expert in cloud procurement and cloud financial operations. Before joining Roku, Dieter was an engineer at Google, Netflix, and Intuit, where he established infrastructure efficiency programs that combined cloud operations, analytics, and finance.
